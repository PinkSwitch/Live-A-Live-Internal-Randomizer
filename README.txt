-LIVE A LIVE RANDOMIZER V2.2-  4/04/2023

Welcome to the Live A Live SFC Randomizer! The randomizer is a modification to the base game allowing for randomization of the game's various elements. Randomization is handled inside of the ROM itself, with no need for seeded roms or external programs. In order to use the randomizer, you will need FLIPS (Or any program that can patch .BPS files), as well as a copy of the 2.0 English fan translation patch. Simply apply the patch over the fan translation ROM, and play. From the title screen, you will be taken to the Randomizer menu, which can be opened at any time during normal gameplay by going to the [Sound] option from the pause screen, and selecting the [Randomizer] option. The game can only save data for one seed at a time, but this seed will persist between save files and resets until another seed has been generated. Settings can be changed mid-game, though Major Characters will not take effect on the current chapter unless it is restarted.

Enjoy! -Pink Switch, 2023

Which patch file should I use?
	(JP) should be patched over the original Japanese rom.
	(EN) should be patched over the english translation.
Some prepatched copies may or may not work. Regardless of which patch is used, the Randomizer will still be in English.


Changes from the base game:

-Holding B during dialogue will now automatically skip and close the current textbox. This does not work on choice prompts, menu text, item pickups, or the Sci-Fi chapter's terminal text.

-Text prompts during the Sci-Fi chapter will now accept any input as correct regardless of what was entered.

-The Trial of Technique will now accept any skill usage to break rocks.

-Files 3 and 4 have been removed to accomodate saved randomizer data.

-The Music menu has been replaced with the Randomizer menu and is open from the start of the game.

-[Hard Protect] and [System Recover] have been slightly tweaked to accomodate weaker characters.

-Some characters in the Wrestler chapter have received slight buffs to be closer to the chapter's expected difficulty.

-Fighters can now be refought during the Wrestler chapter.

-The Knight chapter is now available from the start of the game. All chapters must be completed including Knight to unlock the Final Chapter.

-Characters in the Cowboy chapter have received slight buffs to make the chapter more playable.
  
-[BonkBonk] and [Teh! Teh!] have been slightly tweaked to make Bel more viable as a starting character.

 -All characters can now learn their skillsets from fighters in the Wrestler chapter, even if those skills are not in the fighters' moveset. When a character is hit with a skill Masaru could normally learn, that character will learn their own skill of that respective level. If a character is hit with a learnable attack, but does not gain a skill, it means that character does not have a corresponding skill in their learnset. 
 and Cube can learn the Robotic Accessory skills via this method, however they will lose any newly gained skills once the fight has ended. Equipping the accessories directly will still unlock the skills as normal in all chapters.

-If major characters are shuffled, the Inheritors will learn the skill in the same slot that the master's character previously used on them, but will not gain any skills if this is a slot they already had or if this slot has no skill assigned to it. This will very likely change in the future.
		
-The item minigame in the Caveman chapter has been slightly changed. The last caveman you need to talk to to receive the materials now has a unique color from the others to stand out more.
	 
-The scent tutorial in the Caveman chapter can now be skipped by talking to the elder while outside.
	
-King Mammoth has been made always visible.

-Story progression in the Mecha chapter has been streamlined.
*Watanabe no longer needs to be spoken to after he leaves the TV in order for him to get the medicine.
*The staircase to Toei's basement has been reduced to one screen.
*The sequence to get Taeko's Panties has now been made an optional sidequest.
*You no longer need to talk to Kaori to learn that Matsu went to the facility after he leaves the harbor.
*You no longer need to explore the entire burning orphanage before being able to find Kaori.

Settings:
   -Character Skills:
		|Normal: All characters will learn the same skills they would learn in the normal game, at their normal levels.
		|Shuffled: Skill learnsets will be randomized with each other, and skills will be learned at their normal levels. Each character will have a unique learnset.
		|Random Restricted: All characters will be given a skillset of 16 randomized skills from any character's learnset. The first skill will always be a damaging skill, and a character cannot learn duplicate skills. However, multiple characters may have the same skill as each other.
		|Random w/ Enemies: The same as Random Restricted, but allows characters to potentially learn a select few skills that are normally exclusive to enemies, such as Pulsar Walk.
		|Random w/ Items: The same as Random Restricted, but allows characters to potentially learn skills that can only be used by items, such as Area Great-Heal.
		|Random Full: The same as Random Restricted, but characters will be able to learn any skill available without restriction.
			Characters cannot learn any duplicate skills, but may share skills with another character. Each character will gain one skill per level,
			regardless of how many skills they can normally learn, except at level 15. The first skill learned will always be guranteed to be a damaging attack.
			If Skills is set to anything other than Normal, Buriki Daioh will gain 4 completely random skills regardless of the skill setting.
		
	-Major Characters:
		|Normal: The 8 chapter protagonists are the same as in the normal game.
		|Shuffled: The 8 chapter protagonists will be shuffled amongst each other.
		|Randomized: The 8 chapter protagonists will be randomized to be any potential party member in the game. If Auxillary Characters is not set to Randomized, this will act the same as Shuffled.
			Characters can not be duplicates regardless of settings chosen. The Master will be replaced with the chosen inheritor, which fall under Auxillary Characters, at the end of the chapter.
			(NOTE: Currently the Mind Dungeon cannot be accessed if Akira is not able to join the finale party, but this will not affect any endings.)
	 
	-Auxillary Characters:
		|Normal: Secondary chapter party members will be the same as in the normal game.
		|Swapped: Secondary chapter party members will be swapped amongst the other party members within that chapter, excluding the protagonist.
		|Shuffled: Secondary chapter party members will be shuffled amongst other party members across the game, but cannot be any of the major characters.
		|Randomized: Secondary chapter party members will be randomized to any character, potentially including major characters. If Major Characters is not set to Randomized, this will act the same as Shuffled.
			Characters can not be duplicated regardless of settings chosen. The mimic in the Ninja chapter will always mirror the leader of that chapter, regardless of which character they actually are.
			Auxillary Characters are automatically balanced by the chapter they appear in.
		
	  
	-Robot Equipment: 
		|Normal: Cube and Taro will learn extra skills when equipping the Kotobuki Lacquer, Stone Cannon, Kintoto Cannon, Hiyokokko Cannon, Bounce Gun, 100v Laser, Stun Gun, or Plasma Spark.
		|Random Accessories: Equipment that unlocks extra skills for Cube and Taro will be randomized, but can only be other Accessories.
		|Random Unique: Equipment that unlocks extra skills for Cube and Taro can be in any equipment slot, but gurantees more than one skill can't be locked on the same equipment slot.
		|Random Unrestricted: Equipment that unlocks extra skills for Cube and Taro can be in any equipment slot, potentially having multiple skills locked by the same equipment slot.
			There is a new NPC located in the antique shop's lower floor during the Mecha Chapter. They will tell you which equipment unlocks skills.
			Skill-granting equipment is guranteed to be something that Cube can equip, but not necessarily Taro.
	  
	-Character Colors:
		|Normal: Characters will always use their proper colors, barring a few specific instances (see Q/A for more details)
		|Battle/Menu: Characters' full detail appearance will use a randomly selected color scheme of another character in battles and menus
		|Overworld Only: Characters will use a randomly selected color scheme while on the overworld, not counting NPC characters (see Q/A for more details)
		|Full: Characters will use a random, and not necessarily matching, color scheme for their overworld and detailed appearances.
	
	-Menu Colors: All menu boxes outside of battle will be assigned a colored theme, akin to the box flavors from Earthbound.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known Issues:

    -Holding B during chapter intro and ending cutscenes skips displaying the text, but the cutscene time is unchanged.
	
    -The Trial of Mind cannot be entered if Akira is not playable in the Final chapter.
	
    -Sprites on the file menu do not currently match the randomized character.

    -Characters with names longer than 6 characters occasionally mess with text formatting.

    -The Xin Shan Quan master's name overfills the name entry textbox in chapters other than Kungfu.

    -The character on the seed/setting input uses incorrect graphics when loaded from the boot menu.
	
	-Sometimes Robot Accessory values can be overwritten. The cause is currently unknown.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q/A:

Q: Why do some characters use the wrong colors or appear differently?
	
A: Gori, Bel, Zaki, Taro, and Matsu use color sets that are specific to the Caveman and Mecha chapters respectively. They will still attempt to use their normal colors, but outside of these chapters those colors will be different. Characters that are not in the party, such as in the Final chapter or Auxillary Characters during scenes, load their colors differently from the player party and use their original intended colors. This may be subject to change in the future. Characters will still load the original sprites for special animations, as per the lack of matching animations for a character randomized in their slot.
	
Q: How do I use Power Parts if both Taro and Cube are in my party?

A: Power Parts will be used in formation order- Up, Left, Right, Down. The order can be changed using the [Form] option on the menu.

Q: Why do some characters not learn skills in the Wrestler chapter?

A: Characters that start above level 2 will already have some of the learnable skills unlocked, and will not need to learn them from the wrestler battles.
